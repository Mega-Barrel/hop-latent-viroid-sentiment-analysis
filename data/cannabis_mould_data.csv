2023-07-14T12:40:00.000Z,@MedBudCIC,"Where is the evidence for irradiated cannabis being better for 'immune-compromised' patients?

We've heard this bold claim a few times, but it seems pseudo-scientific when the 'bioburden' of irradiated cannabis is sometimes higher than that of non-irradiated 🤷‍♂️

Doctors need to be provided with COAs (as legally required in Germany) to make informed decisions on each product on a case by case basis - with oversight on mould, yeast, moisture levels etc. - and not to try make poor assumptions based on the irradiation methods used. There's no public data released on how much each product has been irradiated, and it can't be judged as a binary 'yes or no' process.

Moreover, if something is compliant with the 5.1.4/8 monograph then it has reached already been shown to have safe 'bioburden' levels as best understood by regulators - and shouldn't be a threat to immune-compromised patients.

The fact that the 99% who aren't immune-compromised have to deal with cannabis that has intentionally had terpene content destroyed via irradiation, when the logic for doing so seems flawed - frustrates patients immensely.

Patients understand that irradiation can be a short-cut in the drying process and allow producers to get product to market more quickly, and in many ways it feels that this financial benefit to them is being misportrayed as an exercise in patient safety.

Sorry for the preach, and no accusations being thrown at Mamedica here regarding untoward practices - but the claim above that irradiated cannabis is safer for immune-compromised patients is entirely misleading.",https://twitter.com/MedBudCIC/status/1679833240159285248,,10,1,4,0,True,2023-07-14,weekday,2023,"Where is the evidence for irradiated cannabis being better for 'immune-compromised' patientsWe've heard this bold claim a few times, but it seems pseudo-scientific when the 'bioburden' of irradiated cannabis is sometimes higher than that of non-irradiated 🤷‍♂️Doctors need to be provided with COAs as legally required in Germany to make informed decisions on each product on a case by case basis - with oversight on mould, yeast, moisture levels etc. - and not to try make poor assumptions based on the irradiation methods used.
